<!--Next is a link to the cascading style sheet or CSS file. Web designers use a cascading stylesheet CSS to add styling to a website. Designers do this by "calling" a <div class> in HTML and defining the class attributes on the style sheet. Doing so saves time and results in less code. On the style.css page you'll find attributes relating to font, text size, image size, among other details.-->

<!-- We'll need to do some more work in this section, but to do so, we'll need to make some changes on your style.css file. Developers refer to this division as a "Hero Block," but we will refer to it as a "Wide Image."  Think carefully about the image you select and how it might serve a sybolic function in your life. Ulmer refers to these kinds of symbolic images as "wide images" in that they often repeat over and over in our lifetime. We will similarly repeat this image at the end of your Electrate Infuego composition to establish a motif in this web document.-->

<!--The hero image is controlled on the style.css page. To replace this image, simply place a .jpg file in the same file folder (directory) as this project and name it hero.jpg. Alternatively, if you are working with a .png, you will need to open the style.css file using your text editor, and change the file type from .jpg to .png. Browsers will only work with .jpg, .jpeg, or .png imgaes. Since hero images need to stretch across the screen, typically you will want to select an image 1200px in width to allow quick load time yet avoid pixilation.-->

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>Hi! I'm Lilly Poon and I am a freshman at Pitt intending on majoring in computer engineering. I have some proficiency in the programming languages java and python. I was raised in Emmaus, Pennsylvania by my mother and older sister. In the photo below on the right side, is my sister, my mother, and me from left to right. Yes, my sister was not paying attention when I took this photo. And Yes, I did not take another one. Continuing on, in elementary school, my mother brought my sister and I to a church. This church would be the church I would spend much time volunteering and learning at and would get baptized in August of 2021. I'm still Christian today as a result of my church's longstanding love and care for my family and I. </p>
